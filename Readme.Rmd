# Overview

This is my thesis for the TU Munich. The document has been written in R Studio with the Bookdown package.

The final version of the thesis can be viewed here.

## Structure

This github respository has been prepared in a reproducible manner. 

1.    In the Analysis folder you will find all the R source files which I ran. This includes:

   - The Useful Functions source file with all the user defined functions used.

2.    In the Data folder (which is a sub-folder of Analysis) you will find:
   
   - All the data used
   - The makefile used to create the data-sets
